# vc-publish Reference

Detailed reference for the vc-publish skill.

## .vc-publish-config

Create this file in the project root to tell vc-publish where the kit repo checkout lives:

```json
{
  "kitRepoPath": "/Users/you/vibecode-pro-max-kit"
}
```

- The path must point to a git checkout of `github.com/withkynam/vibecode-pro-max-kit.git`
- The checkout must have `vc-manifest.json` at its root
- If missing, the skill asks the user for the path interactively
- Add `.vc-publish-config` to `.gitignore` -- it contains a local machine path

## CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md Content Stripping

When publishing, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md must be harness-only.

### Sections to KEEP (harness methodology)

- Coding conventions (TS inference, result pattern, `as const`)
- RIPER-5 methodology (all mode descriptions)
- Orchestrator role and responsibilities
- Mode detection and auto-orchestration patterns
- Routing protocol (intent detection, context gathering, subagent routing)
- Phase transition rules
- Key principles (phase locking, safety, efficiency)
- Skill registry table (skills are harness-provided)
- Available agents table
- Quick start and troubleshooting sections
- Shared process folder structure description

### Sections to STRIP (project-specific)

- Technology stack details (frameworks, databases, versions)
- Feature list / "Current features" entries
- Project-specific context groups
- Hardcoded package manager (replace with generic)
- MCP server instructions (project-specific config)
- Project-specific routing rules
- Absolute paths (`/Users/...`)
- Product name references ("Flowser", "flowser-turborepo")

### Strategy

Maintain harness-only CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md directly in the kit repo as canonical versions. When publishing:

1. Compare methodology sections between dev repo and kit repo
2. If dev repo has newer methodology (new agents, skills, routing), apply to kit repo's harness-only version
3. Never blindly copy dev repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md to kit repo

## Error Handling

| Error | When | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| `.vc-publish-config` missing | Step 1 | Ask user for kit repo path interactively |
| Kit repo path doesn't exist | Step 1 | Print error, stop |
| Kit repo has no `vc-manifest.json` | Step 2 | Print "not a valid kit repo", stop |
| Kit repo has uncommitted changes | Step 2 | Warn user, suggest stashing. Do not block. |
| No changes to publish | Step 6 | Report "nothing to publish", stop |
| Leak detection finds project content | Step 9 | Print matches, **stop before committing** |
| Git push fails | Step 11 | Print error, suggest checking access. Commit/tag are local -- user can retry. |
| Version tag already exists | Step 10 | Print error, suggest bumping to next version |

## Version Bump Semantics

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| **Patch** (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1) | Bug fixes, minor doc updates | Hook bugfix, skill doc clarification, prompt tweak |
| **Minor** (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0) | New features, additive changes | New skill, new agent, new protocol, new seed template |
| **Major** (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0) | Breaking changes | CLAUDE.md structure change, manifest schema change, removed skills |

## Leak Detection Patterns

Grep the kit repo for these patterns BEFORE committing:

```bash
# Project-specific product names
grep -ri "flowser\|tRPC\|Prisma\|Supabase\|CloakBrowser\|OpenClaw" CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md

# Absolute paths
grep -r "/Users/" .

# Machine-specific config
grep -r "localhost:[0-9]" CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md

# Specific service URLs
grep -ri "supabase\.co\|vercel\.app\|clerk\.dev" CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
```

If any match: print every match with file path and line number, ask user to fix, do NOT commit until clean.
